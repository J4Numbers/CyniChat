CyniChat
========

Current Progress
----------------

At the moment, the plugin is in its' planning stage for the most part. I have added the help documentation as a general reminder for me as to what commands to add at a later point in time, and the help does show up, so hooray for that.

To Do
-----

-Flesh out the permission planning
-Add Methods for the majority of the remaining commands
-Add in intra-player chatting
-Allow for channels to be created and destroyed

Note
----

Aside from this, no further progress can be made until Bukkit 1.6 is created. This is due to potential changes in the formatting of chat messages and any chat events which may be relied upon.
