==CyniChat

CyniChat is chat channel plugin, very similar to HeroChat. It is completely open source and has a number of features that make it useful to any server. However, this plugin will offer a much smoother experience during use. By using alternative storage methods, this plugin will be much faster to load, and much more efficient than the current champion.

===Key Features
* Chat channel capabilities
* Customisable channels
* The ability to kick, ban and mute people in any one channel
* The ability for individual players to ignore people they choose to (unless otherwise specified)
* The ability to promote and demote individuals inside a channel
* A dialogue system (two people chatting)

===Players and Channels
As I mentioned previously, people in your server will be able to ignore other people whom they might not get along with. But since some people might try to ignore the moderators and the operators on your server, you can set them to unignorable in their config files. This option means that no-one will be able to ignore them when they speak unto the masses.

Additional options in the config file for the players include whether they are globally muted or not, what channel they're currently in, that they're banned in, muted in and who they're ignoring. These should only be altered outside of the game if you know know what you are doing with JSON/SQL.

The channel configuration file, on the other hand, contains a lot of customisable content. On creation, each channel is given a few bits and pieces for their details. These include:

|=Keyword|=  Description|
|ID | This refers to the order of creation and the order that channels will appear in the list view|
|Name | This is the full, verbose name that will appear in the list view|
|Nick | This is the shortcut that you can use to quickly join the channel, as opposed to typing the full channel name|
|Desc | This is the description that is shown to players in the channel information view|
|Pass | This is a settable password that you can use to restrict who joins your channel|
|Colour | This controls the colour of the channel fairly obviously enough. Please use the correct names when editing|
|Protect | If this is set to true, the channel will require an additional permission to leave, join and talk|

===Caveats
* This plugin stores files in either JSON files, or in an SQL database
* This plugin currently has a partial dependency on Vault
* Vault will need a permissions plugin for this plugin to run properly

===Future Features
All of the above are definite guarantees for when the plugin reaches //released// status and make up the basic parts of the plugin. What follows are some features that are likely to be added into the plugin at a later date:
* IRC integration via Pircbot or Pircbotx
* An event that other plugins can listen in to
* A web interface to alter the data in the files/database

(This list is liable to be added to at any point in time)

===Got An Idea?
Great, share it with me on either the comments or over a message. If I like it, I'll probably add it into the alpha build. The same goes for any concerns, if you have worries that this is going to break catastrophically with all of the things, then please, speak up. I'd like to be able to rid any potential threats from this so that it is as stable as it needs to be.


==Note

Since this is still in the alpha phase of creation, details on this page are likely to change in accordance with the necessary alterations in the code.
