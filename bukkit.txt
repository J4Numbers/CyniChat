==CyniChat

CyniChat is a chat channel plugin, very similar to HeroChat. It is completely open source and has a number of features that make it useful to any server. However, this plugin will offer a much smoother experience during use. By using alternative storage methods, this plugin will be much faster to load, and much more efficient than the current champion.

===Key Features
* Chat channel capabilities
* Customisable channels
* The ability to kick, ban and mute people in any one channel
* The ability for individual players to ignore people they choose to (unless otherwise specified)
* The ability to promote and demote individuals inside a channel
* A dialogue system (two people chatting)

===Players and Channels
As I mentioned previously, people in your server will be able to ignore other people whom they might not get along with. But since some people might try to ignore the moderators and the operators on your server, you can set them to unignorable in their config files. This option means that no-one will be able to ignore them when they speak unto the masses.

Additional options in the config file for the players include whether they are globally muted or not, what channel they're currently in, that they're banned in, muted in and who they're ignoring. These should only be altered outside of the game if you know know what you are doing with JSON/SQL.

The channel configuration file, on the other hand, contains a lot of customisable content. On creation, each channel is given a few bits and pieces for their details. These include:

|=Keyword|=  Description|
|ID | This refers to the order of creation and the order that channels will appear in the list view|
|Name | This is the full, verbose name that will appear in the list view|
|Nick | This is the shortcut that you can use to quickly join the channel, as opposed to typing the full channel name|
|ircChannel | This is the channel name in the IRC server that you'd like the plugin to join //Next Release//|
|ircPassword | This is the corresponding password to the field above. Any channels without passwords can be left blank //Next Release//|
|Desc | This is the description that is shown to players in the channel information view|
|Pass | This is a settable password that you can use to restrict who joins your channel|
|Colour | This controls the colour of the channel fairly obviously enough. Please use the correct names when editing|
|Protect | If this is set to true, the channel will require an additional permission to leave, join and talk|

===Caveats
* This plugin stores files in either JSON files, or in an SQL database
* This plugin currently has a **hard** dependency on Vault (So if you're not running Vault, you won't be able to run this. Sorry)
* Vault will need a permissions plugin for this plugin to run properly
* Be aware that, since this plugin is still in alpha, there will be some bugs lying around

===Future Features
All of the above are definite guarantees for when the plugin reaches //released// status and make up the basic parts of the plugin. What follows are some features that are likely to be added into the plugin at a later date:
* A web interface to alter the data in the files/database **Confirmed Feature in progress**

(This list is liable to be added to at any point in time)

===Got An Idea?
Great, share it with me on either the comments or over a message. If I like it, I'll probably add it into the alpha build. The same goes for any concerns, if you have worries that this is going to break catastrophically with all of the things, then please, speak up. I'd like to be able to rid any potential threats from this so that it is as stable as it needs to be.


==Note

Since this is still in the alpha phase of creation, details on this page are likely to change in accordance with the necessary alterations in the code. I will put a link to this code here once I have hit a beta creation. For now, it can be found by interpreting the information in the Repository tab above. From there, people are free to do as they please with my source as long as it follows the GNU GPLv3 licence given above.

==Current Progress

I changed my mind... IRC may have had a significant leap forward over the past few hours and may or may not be in the next release that I put out. Lucky you. It is an optional extra in that it is an option in the config for IRC where you can put either 'true' or 'false'. I'll be sure to set it to false on default when this build eventually goes live. Hopefully the options will be intuitive enough for people to simply go through and fill in all the blanks that they need to; if this is not the case then I'll have some documentation on how to do so up at some point or another... probably after I have the actual build up mind you.

Thanks for your patience.
