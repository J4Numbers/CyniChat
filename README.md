CyniChat
=====================

Current Progress
---------------------

All the commands are now up-to-date and have been given method blocks. Whether or not these method blocks work remains to be seen. Channel chatting has been completed, as has a number of other small details. Colours will need to be added as necessary, along with the introduction of nodes such as prefix and suffix.

To Do
---------------------

-Flesh out the permission planning
-Polish dual player chatting (msg and r)
-Add in MySQL implementation of the storage

Note
---------------------

Aside from this, no further progress can be made until Bukkit 1.6 is created. This is due to potential changes in the formatting of chat messages and any chat events which may be relied upon.
