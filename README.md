CyniChat
=====================

Current Progress
---------------------

All the commands are now up-to-date and have been given method blocks. Whether or not these method blocks work remains to be seen. Channel chatting has been completed, as has a number of other small details. There are two methods of data storage: JSON and MySQL, both of which are mostly functional. IRC integration is also operational and in - if not in perfect condition - near-perfect condition.

To Do
---------------------

- Fix any bugs that occur from the current build
- Polish dual player chatting (msg and r)
- Add in a web interface for changing options
