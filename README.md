CyniChat
=====================

Current Progress
---------------------

All the commands are now up-to-date and have been given method blocks. Whether or not these method blocks work remains to be seen. Channel chatting has been completed, as has a number of other small details. Colours will need to be added as necessary, along with the introduction of nodes such as prefix and suffix. There are two methods of data storage: JSON and MySQL, both of which are mostly functional.

To Do
---------------------

- Allow for items to be changed in game
